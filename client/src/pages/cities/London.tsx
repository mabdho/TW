        gettingAround: `## Getting Around London

London has an extensive public transport network, making it easy to get around the city. The tube is the quickest way to travel long distances, while buses are a good option for shorter journeys and scenic routes. Walking is a great way to explore central London, but be prepared for long distances.

## Public Transport
The London Underground (tube) is the most efficient way to travel across the city. Purchase an Oyster card or use contactless payment for travel. Buses are another option, but they can be slower due to traffic. Consider downloading the Citymapper app for real-time travel information. It's a real life saver!
