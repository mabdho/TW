        description: "Often cited as one of the world's most beautiful train stations, the Maputo Central Railway Station is an architectural masterpiece. Designed by associates of Gustave Eiffel, the famed architect of the Eiffel Tower, its striking mint-green facade and magnificent wrought-iron lattice work are a sight to behold. The grand dome, completed in 1910, crowns a building that feels more like a palace than a transportation hub.\n\nWhile still a functioning station, its grandeur far exceeds its current utility. Visitors can wander through the main hall, admire the vintage steam locomotives on display, and soak in the historic atmosphere. The station is not just a transit point but a cultural landmark, home to the Kulungwana Art Gallery and a jazz club, making it a living piece of Maputo's history and a testament to its golden age of rail travel.",

Originally built by the Portuguese in the late 18th century, the current stone structure dates back to the mid-19th century. It stands guard over the harbor, offering a tangible link to a past filled with maritime trade, conflict, and colonial administration. The fort's thick walls and cannons are impressively preserved, providing a powerful sense of history.\n\nInside, you'll find a small military history museum and the Gilded Coffin of Ngungunhane, the last ruler of the Gaza Empire who resisted Portuguese rule. The centerpiece is a striking equestrian statue of Mouzinho de Albuquerque, a former colonial governor, which was relocated here from its original city-center location after independence.

The governor never lived in it, and it was moved to its current location.\n\nToday, this unique and elegant building stands as a historical folly and a popular tourist attraction. Its intricate metalwork and verandas are fascinating to examine up close. The building now houses a small office for the National Directorate of Cultural Heritage, but visitors are free to walk around its exterior and admire its unusual design.",
