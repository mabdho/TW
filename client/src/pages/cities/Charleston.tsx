                "description": "A vibrant hub of commerce and culture for over 200 years, the Historic Charleston City Market is an essential stop. Spanning four city blocks, this landmark is one of the nation's oldest public markets. While it once sold produce and provisions, today it's a bustling marketplace filled with local vendors selling everything from artisanal foods and crafts to souvenirs. The market is particularly famous for its 'basket ladies,' Gullah artisans who weave intricate sweetgrass baskets, a craft passed down through generations from their West African ancestors.\n\nWalking through the open-air sheds, you'll feel the city's living history. It's a fantastic place to find unique, locally made gifts and get a literal taste of Charleston. Be sure to explore both the day market and the seasonal night market for a different atmosphere and set of vendors.",

These Georgian-style houses are a signature of the city's charming aesthetic. The story behind the colors varies, with legends suggesting they were painted to help drunken sailors find their way home or to keep the houses cool in the summer heat.\n\nWhile you cannot enter the private residences, the real magic is in the exterior view. A stroll along this street offers a perfect photo opportunity and a glimpse into Charleston's unique architectural preservation. The best light for photography is typically in the morning. It's a quintessential Charleston experience that perfectly captures the city's vibrant personality.",

Located on an island in Charleston Harbor, the fort is only accessible by a scenic ferry ride, which itself provides stunning views of the city, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, and the coastline.\n\nOnce on the island, National Park Rangers provide insightful talks about the fort's history and the events that led to the war.
