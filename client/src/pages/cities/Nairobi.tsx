                "description": "A truly unique experience, Nairobi National Park is the world's only wildlife park situated within a capital city. Just a short drive from the central business district, this pristine grassland is home to a staggering array of wildlife, including four of the Big Five (lions, leopards, rhinos, and buffaloes). The park's iconic backdrop of city skyscrapers juxtaposed with grazing giraffes or a pride of lions is a photographer's dream.\n\nDriving through the park, you can spot black rhinos, which are a critically endangered species, along with zebras, wildebeests, cheetahs, and over 400 species of birds. The Ivory Burning Site Monument, where 12 tons of ivory were burnt in 1989 to protest poaching, is also a poignant stop within the park. A game drive here is an essential Nairobi activity, offering a full safari experience without leaving the city.",

The nursery, located on the edge of Nairobi National Park, cares for baby elephants who have been orphaned due to poaching or other human-wildlife conflict. During the public viewing hour, you can watch the adorable calves being fed from giant milk bottles, playfully rolling in the mud, and interacting with their keepers.\n\nThe keepers provide an informative talk about each elephant's story, their conservation efforts, and the challenges they face. You can also 'adopt' an orphan elephant, which helps fund their care and eventual reintegration into the wild. Itâ€™s an inspiring and educational visit that directly supports a vital conservation cause.",
