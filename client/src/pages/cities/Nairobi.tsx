Local taxis are also available but agree on a fare before starting your trip. For a local experience, you can use 'matatus' (privately owned minibuses) which run on fixed routes and are very cheap, though they can be crowded and drive erratically. 'Boda-bodas' (motorcycle taxis) are quick for short distances but carry higher risks; always insist on a helmet.",

        bestTimeToVisit: "The best time to visit Nairobi is during its two dry seasons: from June to October and from January to February. During these months, the weather is sunny and pleasant, with cooler temperatures, making it ideal for wildlife viewing in Nairobi National Park as animals gather around water sources. The long rains occur from March to May, and the short rains from November to December. While you can still visit during the rainy seasons, game drives can be challenging on muddy tracks.",

Afterwards, head to the nearby Giraffe Centre to feed the giraffes. Have lunch in Karen, then visit the Karen Blixen Museum and the Kazuri Beads Factory. Day 2: City & Culture. Begin at the Nairobi National Museum and Snake Park. In the afternoon, get a panoramic view from the KICC Helipad, then visit the August 7th Memorial Park. Finish your day by shopping at a Maasai Market (check schedule). Day 3: Wildlife & Tradition. Take an early morning game drive in Nairobi National Park. In the afternoon, immerse yourself in Kenyan culture with the dance performances and village tours at Bomas of Kenya."

          question: "Is Nairobi expensive?",
          answer: "Nairobi's cost can vary widely. For tourists, it can be moderately expensive, with international hotels, park fees ($40-$60), and organized tours being the main costs. A meal at a mid-range restaurant might cost $15-25. However, it can also be a budget-friendly destination. Eating at local restaurants ('kibandas'), using matatus for transport, and staying in guesthouses can significantly lower your expenses. A local meal can be as cheap as $3-5."

          answer: "Nairobi has a reputation for crime, and like any major city, requires vigilance. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and snatch-and-grab theft, can occur, especially in crowded areas like the CBD and markets. It's advisable to avoid walking alone at night, especially in unlit areas. Do not display expensive items like cameras and jewelry openly. Use reputable transport options like Uber, Bolt, or hotel-arranged taxis instead of hailing cabs off the street. By being sensible and aware of your surroundings, most visitors have a trouble-free experience."

It's also known as the 'Green City in the Sun' for its warm climate and many green spaces. Furthermore, Nairobi is a major diplomatic and business hub for East and Central Africa, hosting the global headquarters for UNEP and UN-Habitat.
