        suggestedItinerary: "Day 1: Arrive and explore the historical core. Start at Dutch Square (Stadthuys, Christ Church), walk up St. Paul's Hill, and see the A Famosa fort. Explore the Malacca Sultanate Palace Museum. In the evening, have dinner and soak in the atmosphere of Jonker Street. Day 2: Dive into culture. Visit the Baba & Nyonya Heritage Museum, Cheng Hoon Teng Temple, and Kampung Kling Mosque. In the afternoon, take a relaxing Malacca River Cruise, then head up Menara Taming Sari for sunset views.
