Originally a Byzantine basilica, it was converted into a mosque by the Saracens before the Normans transformed it into a cathedral in the 12th century. Its distinctive Arab-Norman style is blended with Gothic, Baroque, and Neoclassical elements, creating a visually stunning, if not entirely cohesive, exterior.\n\nInside, you can explore the Royal Tombs of Norman kings and emperors, including Frederick II. The real treasure, however, is the view from the rooftop. The climb is well worth the effort, offering a spectacular panoramic perspective of Palermo's historic center, with its terracotta roofs stretching out towards the sea and mountains.",

While the Royal Apartments are impressive, the undeniable jewel of the palace is the Cappella Palatina (Palatine Chapel). Built by King Roger II in the 12th century, this private chapel is a masterpiece of Arab-Norman-Byzantine art.\n\nThe entire interior is covered in breathtakingly intricate mosaics depicting biblical scenes against a shimmering gold background. The craftsmanship is astounding, combining Byzantine artistry, Arabic geometric patterns on the wooden ceiling (muqarnas), and Latin-style floor plans.

Famous for its perfect acoustics and as a filming location for the final scenes of 'The Godfather Part III', the theater is a cultural centerpiece of the city.\n\nTaking a guided tour is highly recommended. You'll be led through the opulent auditorium with its velvet seats and magnificent ceiling, the royal box, and various ornate foyers.

What began as a private cemetery for friars expanded to include the city's elite, who paid to be preserved and displayed in their finest attire.\n\nThe bodies line the corridors, organized by profession, gender, and social status. It is a startling and somber spectacle, offering a direct, if unsettling, look at life and death rituals of the past. The star attraction is Rosalia Lombardo, a two-year-old girl who died in 1920 and is so perfectly preserved she appears to be merely sleeping.

The main draw is the incredible street food.

It features a complex arrangement of concentric circles, stairways, and balustrades populated by dozens of nude statues of mythological figures and animals.\n\nIts nude figures were scandalous to the conservative sensibilities of Palermo at the time, particularly given its proximity to the Church of Saint Catherine, earning it the nickname 'Fontana della Vergogna' (Fountain of Shame).

The Church of San Cataldo is an icon of Arab-Norman architecture. Its stark, cubical exterior is topped with three distinctive red domes, a clear sign of Arabic influence. The interior is deliberately austere, creating a powerful sense of medieval spirituality.\n\nNext door, La Martorana (officially the Church of Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio) is the opposite. Its interior is a jaw-dropping explosion of 12th-century Byzantine mosaics, every inch glittering with gold. The scenes of Christ Pantocrator and the Virgin Mary are among the most beautiful of their kind.

Over 6,500 square meters of glittering gold mosaics cover the walls and ceilings, depicting stories from the Old and New Testaments in vivid detail. The central apse is dominated by a gigantic, commanding image of Christ Pantocrator.\n\nDon't miss the adjacent cloister, a tranquil paradise of 228 twin columns, each uniquely decorated with intricate carvings and mosaics. The peaceful garden and fountain in the center provide a moment of calm after the overwhelming splendor of the cathedral.

The museum was brilliantly redesigned by architect Carlo Scarpa after WWII, and his innovative displays are a work of art in their own right.\n\nKey masterpieces include the haunting 'Triumph of Death' fresco, a powerful and macabre work that once adorned a hospital wall, and the famous 'Virgin Annunciate' by Antonello da Messina, a portrait of sublime grace and psychological depth.

          answer: "Compared to other major Italian cities like Rome, Florence, or Venice, Palermo is quite affordable. Accommodation, public transport, and especially food are significantly cheaper.
