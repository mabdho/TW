        description: `## Overview
Tanah Lot is one of Bali's most iconic temples, perched dramatically on a rock formation in the sea. It's a must-see place to visit, especially at sunset. The temple is an important pilgrimage site for Balinese Hindus and offers stunning panoramic views. You might find that the crowds are quite large during peak season, but itâ€™s still worth experiencing this magnificent temple. 

### Best Photo Spots
The best photo opportunities are from the clifftop overlooking the temple at sunset. Arrive early to secure a good spot. Another great angle is from the beach below, capturing the temple against the crashing waves. Consider that some days the tide is too high to safely reach certain areas, so be mindful of the water.

### Insider Tips
Tip: Visit during low tide to walk to the temple base (though non-worshippers can't enter the temple itself). Check the tide times beforehand. The area around the temple has several *restaurants* and *cafes* offering refreshments and meals.`,

        gettingAround: `## Getting Around Bali

Getting around Bali can be an adventure in itself! While public transport is limited, there are several convenient options for exploring the island. The most popular choices are renting a scooter or hiring a private driver. Each option has its pros and cons, so it's worth considering your budget, comfort level, and itinerary before deciding. Many areas are also walkable, especially in towns like Ubud and Seminyak, making it easy to explore local shops and restaurants on foot. Consider the traffic, which can be quite heavy, especially in tourist areas.

### Taxis & Rideshare

For rideshare services, the price is usually fixed within the app.

### Scooter Rental
Renting a scooter is a popular and affordable way to explore Bali. However, it's important to have a valid international driver's license and wear a helmet. Traffic can be chaotic, so it's essential to be a confident driver. Be aware of local traffic laws and road conditions.`,
