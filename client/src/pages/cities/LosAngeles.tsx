The Griffith Observatory is a Los Angeles icon, offering panoramic views of the city, the Hollywood sign, and the cosmos.

Capture stunning photos of the Hollywood sign and the city skyline from the front lawn. The sunset views are particularly breathtaking. There's also a nice vista inside the building itself, looking south.

### Insider Tips
