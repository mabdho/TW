The short elevator ride to the top is well worth it for the stunning panorama of lush forests and urban landscapes. After soaking in the views, descending to the ground-floor café is a quintessential Tampere experience. The café is legendary for its munkki, or sugar-coated doughnuts, which have been made using the same secret recipe for decades. Enjoying a fresh, warm doughnut with a cup of coffee is a beloved local tradition and the perfect reward for a walk through the beautiful Pyynikki ridge park.",
