Commissioned by King Hassan II and completed in 1993, its 210-meter-tall minaret is the second tallest in the world, acting as a beacon for the city. Part of the mosque is built on land reclaimed from the sea, and its roof is retractable, allowing worshippers to pray under the stars on special occasions. The intricate details, from hand-carved stone and wood to stunning marble floors and zellij tilework, represent the finest Moroccan craftsmanship.\n\nAs one of the few mosques in Morocco open to non-Muslims, a guided tour is essential. The tours are conducted in multiple languages and provide fascinating insight into the building's construction, religious significance, and architectural symbolism. The sheer scale and beauty of the prayer hall are breathtaking, making this an unmissable highlight of any visit to Casablanca.",

Its neat alleyways are lined with arcades, souks, and beautiful buildings that house everything from artisan workshops to modern cafes. It's a more relaxed shopping experience than the Old Medina, ideal for finding quality Moroccan goods like leather babouches, djellabas, spices, and pastries.\n\nDon't miss the olive souk, the brass and copperware artisans, and Pâtisserie Bennis, a legendary spot for authentic Moroccan sweets.

Here, you'll find locals haggling for produce, artisans in tiny workshops, and children playing in hidden squares.\n\nThe medina's northern bastion, the Sqala, offers great views of the port and the Hassan II Mosque.
