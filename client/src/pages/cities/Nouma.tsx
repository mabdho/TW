          question: "Is Nouméa expensive?",
          answer: "Yes, Nouméa can be quite expensive. As a French territory, prices for accommodation, food, and activities are comparable to those in Western Europe or Australia, and significantly higher than in other Pacific island nations or Southeast Asia. Many goods are imported, which drives up the cost. To save money, consider self-catering apartments, shopping at local markets and supermarkets, and utilizing the public bus system."
