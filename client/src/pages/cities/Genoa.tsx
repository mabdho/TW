During the height of the Republic of Genoa in the 16th and 17th centuries, these opulent residences were listed on official registers ('rolli') and were used to host visiting state dignitaries. The grandeur of these palaces was meant to showcase the wealth and power of Genoa.\n\nWhile many are now private residences or banks, several are open to the public as museums, such as Palazzo Rosso, Palazzo Bianco, and Palazzo Doria-Tursi, which together form the Strada Nuova Museums on Via Garibaldi. Visiting these palaces provides a stunning glimpse into the city's golden age, with lavish frescoes, gilded halls, and priceless art collections.",

Today, it's a bustling waterfront hub for culture, entertainment, and leisure. It's the perfect place for a stroll, offering beautiful views of the marina, historic buildings, and the sea.\n\nBeyond the Aquarium, the area is home to the Galata Maritime Museum, the Bigo panoramic lift, the Biosfera glass bubble with a tropical ecosystem, and the Neptune Galleon.

Its distinctive facade, with alternating bands of black and white marble, is a hallmark of the Ligurian Gothic style. Construction began in the 11th century, and the cathedral was built and modified over several centuries, resulting in a fascinating mix of architectural styles.\n\nInside, you'll find impressive artwork and historic relics. Don't miss the Treasury Museum (Museo del Tesoro), which houses sacred artifacts, including the Sacro Catino, a glass vessel once believed to be the Holy Grail.

This elegant street, laid out in the 16th century, was designed specifically to house the city's most powerful families. The result is an extraordinary succession of Renaissance and Baroque palaces, each more magnificent than the last.\n\nToday, you can stroll down this pedestrianized street and admire the stunning facades. Three of the most important palacesâ€”Palazzo Rosso, Palazzo Bianco, and Palazzo Doria-Tursiâ€”are open as the Strada Nuova Museums, showcasing incredible art collections featuring works by Caravaggio, Veronese, and Rubens.

Tucked into a small cove, this incredibly picturesque hamlet feels a world away from Genoa, with its colorful houses clustered around a pebble beach where fishing boats are still pulled ashore. It's often compared to the famous villages of the Cinque Terre but offers a more authentic, local atmosphere.\n\nIt's the perfect spot to enjoy a relaxing afternoon. Grab a gelato or a piece of focaccia, find a spot on the beach, and watch the world go by. In the evening, the area's small bars and trattorias come alive, offering fresh seafood with a stunning seaside view.",

Spread over four floors, the museum offers an interactive and engaging journey through centuries of seafaring history, from the age of oars and sails to the era of steamships and transatlantic migration.\n\nThe exhibits are brilliantly curated, featuring life-sized reconstructions of galleys, interactive displays, and a collection of historic maps and globes. A major highlight is the exhibit dedicated to Italian emigration to the Americas. Your ticket also includes a tour of the S-518 Nazario Sauro submarine, moored just outside.",

Its powerful beam can be seen from over 50 kilometers away.\n\nWhile you can't climb to the very top, a visit allows you to walk along a 800-meter promenade built on the old city walls, leading to the lighthouse complex. Inside, a museum details the history of the city and its port. The first terrace of the tower is accessible, offering spectacular panoramic views of the port and the city.",
