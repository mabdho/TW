This sprawling 20,000-square-meter complex is a labyrinth of vividly colored streets, cloisters, and private cells painted in intense shades of ochre, indigo, and geranium red. Founded in 1579, it housed cloistered nuns, many from wealthy Spanish families who paid substantial dowries for their admission.\n\nExploring the monastery feels like walking through a living museum. You can wander through the former living quarters, kitchens, and chapels, gaining a fascinating insight into the secluded lives of the nuns. The vibrant colors against the bright blue Andean sky make it a photographer's paradise, and the sheer scale and historical depth make it Arequipa’s most unmissable attraction.",

Unlike most Peruvian cathedrals, it stretches the entire length of the plaza, creating a commanding presence. The twin-towered structure has been rebuilt several times following earthquakes, showcasing a resilient blend of Neoclassical and neo-Renaissance styles.\n\nSpend time admiring the facade, relaxing by the central fountain, and people-watching from the balcony of a cafe.

Juanita was a young Inca girl who was sacrificed to the gods on the peak of Mount Ampato over 500 years ago. Her body was naturally mummified and preserved by the ice, and she was discovered in 1995 after a nearby volcano eruption melted the ice cap.\n\nThe museum provides crucial context about the Inca practice of human sacrifice and high-altitude rituals. A short introductory film explains the discovery, followed by a tour of the artifacts found alongside her, including textiles and pottery. The climax is viewing Juanita herself, preserved in a special climate-controlled glass case. It's a somber but unforgettable experience that connects you directly to the ancient Andean world.",
