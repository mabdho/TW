The rows of white headstones are set on a beautiful, peaceful lawn that slopes down a hill, creating a powerful and poignant atmosphere.\n\nReading the inscriptions and taking in the scale of the sacrifice is a sobering experience that provides a crucial historical perspective on the region.

The drive itself, up through the Sogeri Plateau, is scenic and provides a glimpse into the rugged interior of the country.",
