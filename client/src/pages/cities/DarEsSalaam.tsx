        gettingAround: "Navigating Dar es Salaam is an adventure. Ride-sharing apps like Uber and Bolt are widely available, reliable, and generally the safest option for tourists. For shorter trips, three-wheeled auto-rickshaws called 'bajajis' are a cheap and fun way to zip through traffic. For the most local experience, you can use the 'daladalas' (minibuses), which are extremely cheap but often crowded and follow fixed routes. Standard taxis are also available but be sure to agree on a price before you start your journey.",

Budget travelers can find affordable guesthouses scattered throughout the city, particularly around the city center and Kariakoo areas.",
        bestTimeToVisit: "The best time to visit Dar es Salaam is during the two dry seasons. The long dry season from June to October offers pleasant, sunny weather with lower humidity, making it ideal for exploring the city and islands. The short dry season in January and February is also a good time, though it can be hotter. Avoid the main rainy season from March to May, when heavy downpours can cause flooding and disrupt travel plans. The short rains occur in November and December.",
        suggestedItinerary: "Day 1: Historical & Cultural Core. Start at the Kivukoni Fish Market, then take a walking tour of the city center to see the Askari Monument, St. Joseph's Cathedral, and Azania Front Lutheran Church. In the afternoon, explore the National Museum. \nDay 2: Island Escape. Take a boat from The Slipway to Bongoyo Island. Spend the day swimming, snorkeling, and relaxing on the beach with a fresh seafood lunch. Return in the late afternoon for sundowners at The Slipway. \nDay 3: Art, Markets & Beach. Visit the Tinga Tinga Arts Co-operative Society and the Mwenge Woodcarvers Market for souvenir shopping. In the afternoon, head to Coco Beach to experience the local vibe and enjoy some street food."

          question: "Is Dar es Salaam expensive?",
          answer: "Dar es Salaam can cater to all budgets. It can be very affordable if you eat at local restaurants (a meal can cost $3-5 USD) and use bajajis or daladalas for transport. However, it can also be expensive if you stay in high-end hotels, dine at international restaurants on the peninsula, and use private taxis.

          question: "Is Dar es Salaam safe?",
          answer: "Dar es Salaam is a large city and, like any metropolis, requires visitors to be cautious. The primary concern is petty crime, such as pickpocketing and snatch-and-grab theft, particularly in crowded areas like markets and bus stations. It's advisable not to walk alone at night, especially in unlit areas. Use trusted transport like Uber/Bolt or hotel-recommended taxis. Keep valuables out of sight and be aware of your surroundings. With these common-sense precautions, your visit should be safe and enjoyable."
