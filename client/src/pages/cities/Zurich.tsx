The Altstadt, or Old Town, is the heart of Zurich, a charming maze of cobblestone streets, historic buildings, and quaint shops. It's the kind of place where you can easily spend hours just wandering and soaking in the atmosphere. There's a lot to see, and I think it's probably one of the best things to do in Zurich for first-time visitors.

### Best Photo Spots
Don't miss the picturesque Lindenhof hill for panoramic views of the city. Also, the Weinplatz offers a lovely backdrop for photos with its colorful buildings.

### Insider Tips
Tip: Explore the side streets for hidden courtyards and unique shops. The best time to visit is early morning to avoid the crowds, perhaps around 8:00 AM when locals are just starting their day. Avoid the main shopping streets during peak hours, as they can get quite congested.`,
