The state park, located on the southern shore, offers panoramic views, a marina, and opportunities for sailing and wildlife viewing.\n\nThe lake's environment is surreal, with vast, reflective waters meeting stark, mountainous horizons. It's a particularly stunning spot for sunsets, as the fading light paints the sky and water in brilliant hues. Be sure to check water levels and conditions before planning a swim, as they can vary significantly.",
