                "description": "The National Flag Memorial is Rosario's most iconic landmark and a symbol of Argentine patriotism. This colossal modernist monument marks the spot where Manuel Belgrano first raised the Argentine flag in 1812. The complex is divided into three parts: the 70-meter-high Tower, the Civic Courtyard, and the Triumphal Propylaeum, which houses the remains of an unknown soldier.\n\nVisitors can take an elevator to the top of the tower for breathtaking 360-degree views of the city, the Paraná River, and the surrounding islands. The eternal flame burning in the Propylaeum adds a somber, reflective touch. It’s not just a monument; it's the heart of the city's civic life and a must-see for understanding local and national pride.",

Stretching for several kilometers, this series of parks, promenades, and beaches invites locals and tourists alike to walk, jog, cycle, or simply relax. On weekends, the area buzzes with energy as families and friends gather to share mate, a traditional Argentine tea.\n\nStarting from the Flag Memorial, you can walk north through green spaces like Parque de España and Parque Sunchales, passing by chic bars and restaurants with stunning river views. It’s the perfect place to watch the sunset over the water and get a true feel for the city's laid-back rhythm.",

The silos, brightly painted in vertical stripes, have become a modern icon of the city. The museum is an annex of the older Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum and focuses exclusively on contemporary Argentine art.\n\nThe collection is dynamic and thought-provoking, displayed across eight floors within the circular walls of the silos. Climbing the structure provides progressively impressive views of the river and the city, culminating in a spectacular panorama from the top floor.",
