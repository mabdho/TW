                "description": "A truly heartwarming and essential stop, the Lilayi Elephant Nursery is a project by Game Rangers International (GRI) dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating orphaned elephant calves. The nursery provides a safe haven where these vulnerable animals are cared for by dedicated keepers before their eventual re-integration into the wild in Kafue National Park. Visitors can watch the baby elephants during their daily feeding and mud bath from a special viewing platform. An informative talk from the GRI team explains the conservation challenges and the individual stories of the rescued elephants. It's an inspiring experience that directly supports vital conservation work and offers a unique opportunity to see these magnificent creatures up close in a responsible, ethical setting. The viewing is strictly timed to minimize stress on the animals, making it a well-managed and impactful visit.",

The statue commemorates the freedom fighters who died during the struggle for independence, which was achieved in 1964.
