                "description": "A UNESCO World Heritage site, Old Havana is the city's historic heart and a living museum. Its five large plazas, including the magnificent Plaza de la Catedral and the bustling Plaza Vieja, are connected by a labyrinth of narrow, cobblestone streets. Every corner reveals beautifully restored baroque and neoclassical buildings, charming courtyards, and lively street scenes. It's a place to get lost intentionally, discovering hidden cafes, art galleries, and the pulse of daily Cuban life.\n\nSpend hours meandering without a plan, soaking in the atmosphere. You'll encounter street musicians, artists selling their work, and locals going about their day. The architectural grandeur, combined with the visible decay of some buildings, creates a poignant and beautiful contrast that defines Havana.",

                "description": "The Malecón is Havana’s legendary 8-kilometer-long esplanade, sea drive, and seawall, stretching from Old Havana to the Vedado neighborhood. It’s often called 'the world’s longest sofa,' as it serves as a massive open-air living room for Habaneros. By day, fishermen cast their lines into the turquoise waters. As the sun sets, the wall comes alive with couples, families, musicians, and friends gathering to chat, drink rum, and enjoy the ocean breeze.\n\nA walk along the Malecón offers a cross-section of Cuban life against a backdrop of crumbling, salt-sprayed buildings and the crashing waves of the Straits of Florida. It's an essential experience, especially at sunset when the sky erupts in color and the classic cars cruising by seem to glow.",

                "description": "No trip to Havana is complete without a ride in one of the iconic 1950s American classic cars. These 'almendrones,' as they are locally known, are meticulously maintained relics from a bygone era, gleaming in vibrant shades of pink, turquoise, and red. Taking a city tour in a convertible Cadillac or Chevrolet is one of the most stylish and enjoyable ways to see the sights.\n\nMost tours last for one to two hours and typically cover major landmarks like Plaza de la Revolución, El Morro fortress, the Malecón, and the grand mansions of the Vedado and Miramar districts. It's a fantastic photo opportunity and a truly unique way to experience the city's scale and grandeur.",

This is the home and workshop of artist José Fuster, who has transformed his entire neighborhood into a massive, surrealist art installation inspired by Gaudi's work in Barcelona. Over several decades, Fuster has covered his own home and over 80 neighboring houses with whimsical, colorful mosaic tiles.\n\nWalking through Fusterlandia feels like stepping into a dream. The art depicts Cuban life, fantastical creatures, and Santería symbols. It's a joyful, imaginative, and utterly unique public art project that showcases the incredible creativity and community spirit of the Cuban people.",

Its iconic lighthouse has become a symbol of the city. The fortress was built to protect Havana from pirates and foreign invaders, and its stone walls and cannons tell tales of colonial battles.\n\nVisitors can explore the ramparts, dungeons, and old barracks while enjoying breathtaking panoramic views of the Malecón and the city skyline. It's particularly impressive at sunset. Across the road is the even larger La Cabaña fortress, where a traditional cannon-firing ceremony (El Cañonazo) takes place nightly at 9:00 PM.",

Set in a lush tropical garden in the Marianao district, this legendary institution offers a spectacular showcase of Cuban music and dance. The show features hundreds of performers in extravagant, feathered, and sequined costumes, performing intricate choreography under the stars.\n\nWhile it's a splurge, the Tropicana experience is a throwback to Havana's glamorous golden age. The ticket price usually includes a welcome drink and a bottle of rum to share at your table. It's a night of pure, over-the-top spectacle and vibrant energy that you won't soon forget.",

Its walls are covered in graffiti and signatures from decades of visitors, including Hemingway, Pablo Neruda, and Salvador Allende. The bar claims to be the birthplace of the mojito, and while that's debatable, there's no denying its historic charm.\n\nPush your way through the crowd to the bar, order a famously strong mojito, and listen to the live Son Cubano band that's almost always playing. It's a crowded, touristy, but undeniably classic Havana experience that connects you to the city's storied past.",

While the original Partagás factory behind the Capitolio is now a store, the official tours have been relocated to another working factory. Here, you can watch hundreds of expert 'torcedores' (cigar rollers) sort, roll, and box the famous cigars by hand.\n\nThe tour takes you through the entire process, from the selection of the leaves to the final packaging. The aroma of rich tobacco fills the air, and the skill on display is incredible. It’s an authentic cultural experience that provides a deep appreciation for Cuba's most famous export.",

Flanked by ornate, historic buildings, bronze lion statues, and old-fashioned street lamps, it's one of the most elegant boulevards in the city. It stretches from the Malecón all the way to Parque Central and the magnificent Gran Teatro.\n\nThis is a popular spot for locals to stroll, skateboard, and relax on the marble benches. On weekends, it often hosts art exhibitions and street performances. Walking its length provides a more tranquil experience than the bustling streets of Old Havana and offers a glimpse into the city's former architectural splendor.",

The building itself is a sight to behold, with lavish interiors designed by Tiffany's of New York. Bullet holes from a 1957 student attack on the dictator Batista are still visible on the central staircase.\n\nBehind the museum, in the Granma Memorial pavilion, you'll find the actual yacht that carried Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and 80 other revolutionaries from Mexico to Cuba in 1956. The museum's exhibits are primarily in Spanish, but the artifacts and the grandeur of the setting make it a compelling visit for anyone interested in Cuba's tumultuous past.",
