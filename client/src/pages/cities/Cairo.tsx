Standing at their base is a humbling experience that connects you directly to the distant past. Nearby, the enigmatic Sphinx, a limestone statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, guards the complex. You can explore the plateau on foot, by camel, or on horseback, but be sure to take a moment to absorb the sheer scale and historical significance of these monumental structures.
