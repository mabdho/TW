                "description": "No trip to Cairo is complete without visiting the Giza Plateau, home to the last remaining wonder of the ancient world. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, along with the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure, has stood for over 4,500 years, a testament to the ingenuity and power of the Pharaonic civilization. Standing at their base is a humbling experience that connects you directly to the distant past. Nearby, the enigmatic Sphinx, a limestone statue with the body of a lion and the head of a human, guards the complex. You can explore the plateau on foot, by camel, or on horseback, but be sure to take a moment to absorb the sheer scale and historical significance of these monumental structures. For a truly magical experience, visit during the evening Sound and Light Show.",

Dating back to the 14th century, this labyrinthine market is a whirlwind of sights, sounds, and smells. Narrow alleyways are crammed with shops selling everything from intricate lanterns, spices, and perfumes to jewelry, papyrus, and alabaster statues. Haggling is part of the experience, so don't be shy. Even if you're not shopping, wandering through the souk is an adventure in itself. Be sure to stop at a traditional cafÃ© like El Fishawy's, which has been operating for over 200 years, to enjoy a cup of sweet mint tea and watch the world go by.",

Built by the famous sultan Saladin in the 12th century to protect the city from Crusaders, it served as the seat of Egyptian rulers for nearly 700 years. The complex houses several important sites, most notably the magnificent Mosque of Muhammad Ali. Also known as the Alabaster Mosque for its extensive use of the stone, its Ottoman-style architecture and grand domes dominate the city skyline. Exploring the ramparts, museums, and mosques within the Citadel provides a fascinating glimpse into Cairo's military and political history.",

Key sites include the Hanging Church (El Muallaqa), built atop the bastions of a Roman fortress, the Church of St. Sergius and Bacchus, where the Holy Family is said to have rested, and the Ben Ezra Synagogue, reportedly located where the baby Moses was found.

This measurement was crucial for ancient and medieval Egypt, as it determined the prosperity of the coming year's harvest and the level of taxation. The structure is an ornate, stone-lined pit with a central column marked with cubits. You can descend a staircase into the well to see the intricate Islamic architecture and markings up close.
