This narrow alleyway is a bustling hub of activity, packed with souvenir shops, trendy cafes, and street food vendors selling everything from rainbow cheese toast to refreshing ice balls (ais kepal). The lane retains its old-world charm with traditional shophouses and red lanterns strung overhead.\n\nItâ€™s the perfect place for a leisurely stroll, people-watching, and capturing colourful photos. While it can get crowded, especially on weekends, the lively atmosphere is part of its appeal.

His seven murals in the Old Town depict scenes of local life and culture, from an old man sipping coffee to children flying on a paper plane. These interactive and whimsical pieces have breathed new life into the historic streets and created fantastic photo opportunities.\n\nBeyond Zacharevic's work, numerous other local artists have contributed to Ipoh's street art scene. Grab a mural map or simply wander the alleys around Jalan Masjid and Jalan Market to discover these creative works. It's a fun, free activity that turns the entire Old Town into an open-air art gallery.",

To reach it, you must walk through a short, dark tunnel carved through the rock, which adds to the sense of discovery. As you emerge on the other side, you're greeted by a breathtaking sight: a tranquil lake surrounded by lush greenery and towering cliffs.\n\nOn a calm day, the water's surface perfectly reflects the surrounding scenery, earning it the name 'Mirror Lake'. A jetty allows you to walk out over the water for better views and photos. Recently, boat rides have been introduced to explore the lake further.

Designed by Arthur Benison Hubback, the same architect behind the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, it was completed in 1917. The grand white facade, large central dome, and smaller cupolas make it one of Malaysia's most beautiful railway stations.\n\nStill a functioning station, visitors can admire its architecture from the outside or walk through the main hall. The station square features a beautiful garden and the Ipoh Cenotaph, a war memorial. It's a key landmark on the Ipoh Heritage Trail and a testament to the city's wealth during the tin-mining boom.",

The main prayer hall is located within the natural limestone cave, filled with intricate statues of Buddhist deities.\n\nA unique feature of this temple is the tortoise pond located within its grounds, where visitors can feed the reptiles, which are symbols of longevity.

The climb is rewarded with a spectacular view of Ipoh and its surrounding landscape. The pavilions and pagodas at the top provide a serene spot to rest and take in the scenery.",
