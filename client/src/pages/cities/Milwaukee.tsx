The museum's most iconic feature is the Quadracci Pavilion, a stunning structure designed by Santiago Calatrava with a moveable, wing-like brise soleil that opens and closes daily. This 'wing flap' is a spectacle in itself, drawing crowds at 10 a.m. when it opens, noon, and at closing time.\n\nInside, the museum houses a vast collection of nearly 25,000 works of art, spanning from antiquity to the present. It has one of the largest collections of works by Wisconsin native Georgia O'Keeffe, as well as impressive holdings of German Expressionism, folk and Haitian art, and American decorative arts. The bright, airy interior and the breathtaking views of Lake Michigan make wandering through the galleries an unforgettable experience.",
