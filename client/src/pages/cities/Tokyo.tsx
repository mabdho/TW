Senso-ji Temple, Tokyo's oldest temple, is a vibrant and historically significant landmark. Founded in 645 AD, it's dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon. The temple complex includes the iconic Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate), Nakamise-dori (a street lined with shops), and the main hall.

Tip: Visit early in the morning (around 6:00 AM) to avoid the crowds and experience the temple's serene atmosphere. Don't miss the Omikuji (fortune paper strips); if you receive a bad fortune, tie it to the metal racks to leave the bad luck behind.`,
