It's a religion here, characterized by slow-smoked meats, a thick, sweet, and tangy tomato-based sauce, and beloved side dishes. The city is packed with legendary joints, each with its own fiercely loyal following. From the iconic burnt ends (cubes of brisket point) to fall-off-the-bone ribs and pulled pork, trying KC 'cue is an essential cultural experience.\n\nChoosing where to go is part of the fun. For a classic experience, head to Arthur Bryant's or Gates Bar-B-Q, where you'll be greeted with a loud 'Hi, may I help you?'. For a more modern yet equally revered take, the gas station-born Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que is a must-try, often with a line out the door. Other standouts include Q39, Jack Stack, and Slap's BBQ.",

This is not just a sports museum; it's a civil rights and social history museum told through the lens of baseball. The self-guided tour takes you through a timeline of segregation and the creation of the Negro Leagues, celebrating legendary players like Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and of course, Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier.\n\nThe culminating exhibit is the moving 'Field of Legends,' where nearly life-sized bronze statues of Negro Leagues greats are positioned on a mock baseball diamond as if in the middle of a game. It is a poignant and inspiring tribute that you won't soon forget.",
