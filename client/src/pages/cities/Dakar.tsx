This car-free, UNESCO World Heritage site is characterized by its colonial-era architecture, bougainvillea-draped lanes, and somber history as a major center of the Atlantic slave trade. The island's most visited site is the House of Slaves (Maison des Esclaves), where you can stand in the dimly lit cells and see the 'Door of No Return,' a powerful and moving memorial to the millions who passed through it.\n\nBeyond its dark past, Gorée is also a vibrant community of artists. You can wander through sandy streets, browse local art galleries, and enjoy a quiet meal at a seaside restaurant. The island’s beauty and its profound historical significance make it an essential, unforgettable part of any visit to Dakar.",

The lake's salinity is incredibly high, rivaling that of the Dead Sea, which allows people to float effortlessly on its surface.\n\nYou can take a pirogue (a traditional wooden boat) ride to see the salt harvesters at work, who collect salt from the lakebed and pile it high on the shore. The contrast between the pink water, white salt mounds, and the surrounding dunes is surreal and highly photogenic. It's a popular and fascinating day trip from the capital.",
