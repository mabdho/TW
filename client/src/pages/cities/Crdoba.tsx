This multi-use space now houses art galleries, concert venues, restaurants, and shops, all centered around a large open plaza. It's a popular meeting spot for locals and tourists alike, buzzing with activity day and night.\n\nThe main attraction is the 'dancing waters' show.

Located in Nueva Córdoba, its asymmetrical facade immediately captures attention—one tower is finished while the other is intentionally incomplete, symbolizing humanity's imperfection and the constant journey towards God.\n\nThe church's exterior is adorned with a host of intricate sculptures and gargoyles, while the interior is just as breathtaking, with soaring vaulted ceilings and vibrant stained-glass windows that bathe the space in colored light. It's a masterpiece of detail and symbolism, built by architect Augusto Ferrari, who integrated elements representing both the earthly and heavenly worlds.",

The palace itself is a work of art, with opulent staircases, elegant halls, and beautiful grounds that transport you to a bygone era of Argentine aristocracy.\n\nThe museum's collection focuses on art from Córdoba and Argentina, featuring paintings, sculptures, and graphic works from the 19th century to the present day.

The exhibitions inside cover a wide range of topics, including archaeology, colonial art, and the city's social development. Don't miss the view of the Plaza and Cathedral from the upper-level balconies. It's a key piece of the historical puzzle that makes up central Córdoba.",
