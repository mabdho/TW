          question: "Is Cairns expensive?",
          answer: "Cairns can be as expensive or as affordable as you make it. The main costs are tours to the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Rainforest, which are significant but essential experiences. Accommodation ranges from budget-friendly hostels to luxury resorts. Food and drink prices are comparable to other major Australian cities, but you can save money by using public BBQs and eating at food courts. Overall, it's generally considered more affordable than Sydney or Melbourne, but budgeting for major tours is crucial."

        {
          question: "How many days do you need in Cairns?",
          answer: "A minimum of 3 full days is recommended to experience the two main highlights: one day for the Great Barrier Reef and one day for the rainforest (Daintree or Kuranda). However, to truly appreciate the region without feeling rushed, 5 to 7 days is ideal. This allows for extra time to explore the Atherton Tablelands, relax on an island like Fitzroy, and enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of Cairns itself."

        {
          question: "Is Cairns safe?",
          answer: "Cairns is generally a safe city for tourists. Standard precautions against petty crime, like not leaving valuables unattended, should be taken. The main safety concerns are environmental. Always swim between the flags at patrolled beaches and at the Esplanade Lagoon. During stinger season (typically Nov-May), wear a protective lycra suit in the ocean. Be 'croc-wise' near rivers and estuariesâ€”obey all warning signs and never swim in un-signposted waterways. Sun protection is vital year-round."
        },
        {
          question: "What is Cairns famous for?",
          answer: "Cairns is world-famous for being the primary gateway to two UNESCO World Heritage sites: the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest. Its identity is inextricably linked to these natural wonders. The city is also known for its vibrant, tropical, and laid-back atmosphere, its adventure tourism (bungee jumping, white water rafting), and its role as a major hub for backpackers and international travelers exploring Australia's east coast."
