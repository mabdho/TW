        gettingAround: "The best way for visitors to get around Luanda is by using private taxis or hiring a car with a driver, which can be arranged by hotels. App-based services like T'Leva are also popular. The iconic blue-and-white taxis ('candongueiros') are cheaper but can be crowded and follow fixed routes, making them more challenging for tourists. Walking is pleasant along the Marginal, but for longer distances, a vehicle is necessary due to the city's sprawl and heat.",
        whereToStay: "For luxury, the hotels on the Ilha do Cabo (Hotel Presidente, Talatona Convention Hotel) or in Miramar (Epic Sana) offer top-tier amenities and security. The Baixa (downtown) and Maculusso districts offer good mid-range options with convenient access to sights and restaurants. Budget options are limited and can be of variable quality, so booking well-regarded guesthouses in safer neighborhoods like Miramar is recommended.",
        bestTimeToVisit: "The best time to visit Luanda is during the 'Cacimbo' season, which is the cool, dry season from June to September. During this period, temperatures are pleasant (around 20-25°C or 68-77°F) and there is very little rain. The hot, rainy season runs from October to May and can be very humid with heavy downpours, especially from March to May.",
        suggestedItinerary: "Day 1: Historical Core - Start at Fortaleza de São Miguel for history and views. Walk through Cidade Alta to see the colonial architecture. Descend to the Baixa to see the Iron Palace and Igreja Nossa Senhora dos Remédios. End with a sunset stroll along the Marginal.\nDay 2: Southern Sights - Hire a driver for a day trip south. Visit the poignant National Museum of Slavery, then marvel at the Miradouro da Lua. Continue to Shipwreck Beach for surreal photos before heading back to the city.\nDay 3: Island & Crafts - Spend the morning relaxing at a beach club on the Ilha do Cabo. Enjoy a fresh seafood lunch. In the afternoon, head to the Benfica Handicrafts Market (best on a Sunday) to shop for souvenirs and local art."
