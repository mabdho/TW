Its crisp white walls and bright red turrets create a striking image against the sky.\n\nInside, the castle houses the Museum of History, showcasing Slovak history from the Middle Ages to the present. However, the main draw for many visitors is the breathtaking panoramic view from the castle grounds. You can see the entire Old Town, the Danube River, the modern Petržalka district, and on a clear day, even parts of neighboring Austria and Hungary. A stroll through the restored Baroque garden is a peaceful way to end your visit.",

Visitors can explore the archaeological site, climb what's left of the fortifications, and enjoy spectacular views of the two rivers and Austria across the water.
