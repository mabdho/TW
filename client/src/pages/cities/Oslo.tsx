The park is open year-round and offers a thought-provoking experience with its representations of the human form and life cycle. Seriously, you could spend hours just wandering and contemplating.

### Best Photo Spots

Capture the iconic 'Monolith' at sunset for a stunning backdrop. I found the view surprisingly calming, even with the crowds. Also, don't miss the 'Angry Boy' statue â€“ a classic photo op.

Be prepared for a dark and intimate setting. The frescoes are quite explicit, so it may not be suitable for children or those easily offended. It's a very small room so you will be in close proximity to other visitors.

### Insider Tips
