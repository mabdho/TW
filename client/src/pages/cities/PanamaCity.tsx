The Miraflores Visitor Center is the most accessible place to experience this spectacle. From its tiered observation decks, you can watch colossal container ships and cruise liners being raised and lowered through the locks, a process that has connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for over a century. The on-site museum offers a comprehensive look at the canal's dramatic history, from its challenging construction to its modern expansion.

Today, the archaeological site is a UNESCO World Heritage site where you can wander among the stone remnants of cathedrals, convents, and homes.

The paved road to the top is a steep but manageable 30-40 minute walk, closed to private vehicles. As you ascend, keep an eye out for sloths, toucans, and deer. The reward at the top is a breathtaking vista encompassing Casco Viejo, the modern skyline, the Amador Causeway, and the Bridge of the Americas.

The star of the show is the Panamanian-style ceviche—raw fish cured in lime juice, onions, and cilantro, typically served with crackers or fried plantains.

Even if you're not an expert birder, a walk through the dense rainforest is a fantastic experience. The park is also home to monkeys, sloths, agoutis, and other tropical wildlife.
