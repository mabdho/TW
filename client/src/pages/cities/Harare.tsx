The site is dominated by a towering 40-meter obelisk, the 'Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,' and features two large bronze statues depicting scenes from the war. The architectural style is grand and symbolic, drawing inspiration from socialist-realist design.\n\nA visit here offers profound insight into the nation's history and the sacrifices made for its independence. Guided tours are available and highly recommended, as the guides provide context and narratives that bring the monument's significance to life.

Located in Epworth, a short drive from Harare, the site consists of massive granite boulders weathered by eons of wind and rain into precarious, gravity-defying formations. The most famous grouping, known as the 'Banknote Rocks' or 'Flying Boat,' is a truly astonishing sight.\n\nThe rocks are not just a geological wonder but also hold spiritual significance for the local people. The area is peaceful and offers a fantastic opportunity for photography and a short, reflective walk. It's a perfect half-day trip to witness a unique piece of Zimbabwe's natural artistry.",

It's the perfect place to get your bearings and appreciate the layout of Harare, from its bustling central business district to its leafy residential suburbs.\n\nThis spot is particularly popular at sunrise and sunset when the light casts a golden glow over the city. It's a place of historical significance and natural beauty, offering a moment of tranquility above the urban energy. Due to its relative isolation, it's best to visit during the day and preferably with a driver or in a group.",
