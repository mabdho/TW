The 'shoulder' seasons, April and October-November, can see some rain but also fewer crowds. Colombo experiences two monsoon seasons: the main 'Yala' monsoon from May to August and the less intense 'Maha' monsoon from December to January, so expect higher rainfall during these months.",
        suggestedItinerary: "A simple 3-day itinerary:\n**Day 1: History & Markets:** Start in the Colombo Fort area, exploring the colonial architecture. Dive into the chaos of Pettah Market and visit the Jami Ul-Alfar (Red) Mosque. In the afternoon, immerse yourself in history at the National Museum of Colombo.\n**Day 2: Culture & Sunset:** Visit the magnificent Gangaramaya Temple and the serene Seema Malakaya on Beira Lake. Relax in Viharamahadevi Park, then head to Galle Face Green for a spectacular sunset and street food.\n**Day 3: Art, Shopping & Beach:** Take a pre-booked tour of Geoffrey Bawa's Residence. Explore the chic boutiques at Arcade Independence Square and the Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct for lunch. In the late afternoon, take the train to Mount Lavinia for a relaxing evening on the beach."
