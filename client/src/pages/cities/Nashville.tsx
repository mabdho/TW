          question: "Is Nashville expensive?",
          answer: "Nashville's costs are on par with other major US cities but can vary greatly depending on your choices. While there are many free things to do like walking the pedestrian bridge or listening to music in honky-tonks (with the cost of a drink), ticketed attractions, concerts, and tours can add up. Accommodation in the downtown core is expensive, especially on weekends. Food costs can range from cheap (hot chicken shacks) to very high-end. Overall, it's possible to visit on a budget, but a typical tourist trip can be moderately expensive."

        {
          question: "How many days do you need in Nashville?",
          answer: "A 3-day weekend is the perfect amount of time to get a great taste of Nashville. This allows you to cover the main music attractions downtown, explore a couple of distinct neighborhoods like The Gulch or 12 South, and enjoy the nightlife. If you want to visit more historical sites like The Hermitage or Cheekwood, or take a day trip to nearby Franklin, extending your stay to 4 or 5 days would be ideal for a more relaxed pace."

However, like any large city, it's important to be aware of your surroundings. The crowds on Lower Broadway at night can be intense, so keep your belongings secure. Petty crime like pickpocketing can occur. It's wise to use rideshare services at night rather than walking long distances alone in unfamiliar areas."

          question: "What is Nashville famous for?",
          answer: "Nashville is world-famous as 'Music City.' It's the epicenter of country music, home to legendary venues like the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium, the Country Music Hall of Fame, and countless record labels on Music Row. Beyond country, it's a hub for all genres of live music, which can be heard 24/7 on the Honky Tonk Highway. Nashville is also famous for its Southern cuisine, most notably its signature dish, Nashville Hot Chicken. The city is also a major center for healthcare and education."
