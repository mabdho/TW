Its most iconic landmark is the Saint Boniface Cathedral-Basilica. The original 1908 cathedral was tragically destroyed by fire in 1968, but its majestic stone faÃ§ade was preserved and now serves as a dramatic frame for a modern, smaller church built within its ruins.\n\nThe result is a stunning blend of old and new architecture that is both beautiful and poignant. The surrounding cemetery is the final resting place of many prominent Manitobans, including Louis Riel, the MÃ©tis leader and founder of Manitoba. A visit here offers a peaceful moment of reflection and a glimpse into the region's foundational history.",
