          question: "Is Kathmandu expensive?",
          answer: "Kathmandu is generally a very affordable destination. Budget travelers can easily get by on $25-35 USD per day, staying in hostels, eating local food (a plate of dal bhat costs $2-4), and using local transport. A mid-range budget of $50-70 USD per day allows for comfortable private rooms, dining at a variety of restaurants, and taking taxis. Activities like the Everest flight or hiring private guides will add to the cost, but overall, it's one of the most budget-friendly capitals in the world."
