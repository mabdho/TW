Conversely, it can be extremely luxurious with 5-star palace hotels, fine dining restaurants, and high-end shopping.

This allows you to see the key palaces, gardens, and museums, get lost in the souks, and enjoy the atmosphere of Jemaa el-Fnaa.

            "question": "Is Marrakech safe?",
            "answer": "Marrakech is generally a safe city for tourists. However, like any major city, petty crime like pickpocketing can occur in crowded areas like the souks and Jemaa el-Fnaa, so keep your valuables secure. Be aware of common scams, such as unofficial guides offering to show you the way (then demanding a high fee) or people claiming a particular attraction is closed to lead you to a relative's shop. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites, to show respect for the local culture. Solo female travelers may receive some unwanted attention; being firm and polite, or ignoring it, is usually effective."
