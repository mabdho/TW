From the charming streets of Ljubljana to the vibrant culture of Oaxaca, these hidden gems provide a perfect mix of tranquility, adventure, and authentic local vibes.",
  content: `<p data-start="48" data-end="500">When you think of solo travel, the first destinations that come to mind are probably places like Paris, Tokyo, or maybe even Bali. All beautiful, all popular—and, let’s be honest, often a bit crowded, especially when you’re out exploring on your own. But what if I told you there’s a whole world of underrated spots where you can truly get away, avoid the throngs of tourists, and connect with something a little more unique? Sounds pretty good, right?</p>
<p data-start="502" data-end="986">Don’t get me wrong, there’s a reason those big-name destinations are always on the list, but sometimes, finding the road less traveled can be far more rewarding. You get to explore somewhere new, dive into a different culture, and maybe even leave with a new perspective on what travel can really mean. So, with that in mind, here are a few underrated destinations that, in my opinion, are perfect for solo travelers looking to go off the beaten path—without feeling totally isolated.</p>
<h4 data-start="988" data-end="1019">1. <strong data-start="996" data-end="1019">Ljubljana, Slovenia</strong></h4>
<p data-start="1021" data-end="1536">Okay, I know—Slovenia might not exactly be on the radar for a lot of people. But if you haven’t been, you’re seriously missing out. Ljubljana (pronounced: loo-blyah-nah) is the charming capital city, and I’m honestly a bit surprised it doesn’t get more love. It’s small, walkable, and incredibly friendly. The locals here are some of the nicest I’ve ever met, which made my solo trip feel surprisingly easy. You can wander along the river, pop into cozy cafés, or check out the castle that overlooks the whole city.</p>
<p data-start="1538" data-end="1965">The vibe is laid-back, but there's a lot to do. I think that’s what makes it perfect for solo travel: it feels comfortable, but not too sleepy. And, if you’re a nature lover, you’re surrounded by mountains and lakes that are ideal for hiking, kayaking, or just soaking in the views. It's definitely one of those places where you feel like you're “living the dream,” but without needing a huge budget or a big travel itinerary.</p>
<p data-start="1967" data-end="2102">Curious about what else to do in Ljubljana? Check out <a data-start="2021" data-end="2101" rel="noopener" target="_new" class="cursor-pointer">things to do in Ljubljana</a>.</p>
<h4 data-start="2104" data-end="2130">2. <strong data-start="2112" data-end="2130">Oaxaca, Mexico</strong></h4>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2629">Now, if you want a little more action, culture, and <em data-start="2184" data-end="2191">spice</em> (literally), Oaxaca is a solo traveler’s paradise. It’s got a vibrant arts scene, an incredible food culture (try the mole—trust me), and some of the friendliest locals I’ve ever encountered. There’s something about this city that makes you feel instantly at home. Maybe it’s the colorful markets, or maybe it's just how easy it is to strike up a conversation over a cup of coffee. Either way, you’re never far from something to do here.</p>
<p data-start="2631" data-end="2891">Of course, it helps that Oaxaca’s surroundings are full of cool stuff to explore: ancient ruins, local villages, and hiking trails. The best part? It’s not overrun with tourists, so you don’t have to feel like you’re sharing the experience with everyone else.</p>
<p data-start="2893" data-end="3292">But there’s a little catch. Oaxaca is a city that really thrives on its festivals and events, so timing your visit is important. The Day of the Dead celebrations in particular are... well, just a whole different level. If you’re lucky enough to be there during that time, you’ll probably never experience anything like it. Just don’t get caught off guard by the loud fireworks—they go off randomly.</p>

<h4 data-start="3422" data-end="3448">3. <strong data-start="3430" data-end="3448">Gdansk, Poland</strong></h4>
<p data-start="3450" data-end="3915">If you’re craving a blend of history, good food, and quiet beauty, Gdansk (pronounced: G-dansk) might be just what you’re looking for. It’s often overshadowed by Warsaw or Krakow, but Gdansk is one of those places that feels like it’s been stuck in time—without being <em data-start="3718" data-end="3723">too</em> touristy. The old town is a maze of narrow streets, pastel-colored buildings, and gorgeous architecture. Honestly, I could spend hours just wandering around and soaking it all in. And I have.</p>
<p data-start="3917" data-end="4303">There’s something really special about how peaceful Gdansk feels, even when there are people around. The vibe is just... nice. You can spend your day strolling down the Motlawa River, exploring museums, or just chilling in one of the cozy cafes. I even found some little bookshops that felt like hidden gems. It’s not overwhelming, yet there’s always something new around every corner.</p>
<p data-start="4305" data-end="4563">Also, the food in Gdansk? Delicious. It’s a port city, so seafood is a must-try. But, honestly, even the simpler stuff like pierogi or fresh bread with butter... amazing. There’s just a warmth to the place that makes it easy to forget you’re traveling alone.</p>
<p data-start="4565" data-end="4698">If you’re looking for more suggestions, here’s a guide to <a data-start="4623" data-end="4697" class="cursor-pointer" rel="noopener" target="_new">things to do in Gdansk</a>.</p>
<h4 data-start="4700" data-end="4728">4. <strong data-start="4708" data-end="4728">Tbilisi, Georgia</strong></h4>
<p data-start="4730" data-end="5221">For something a little more adventurous, Tbilisi—Georgia’s capital—could be the perfect spot. The city has an eclectic charm, mixing old-world Eastern European influences with a touch of modern style. The cobbled streets, colorful houses, and quirky cafés are charming enough, but the best part? The people. I don’t think I’ve ever met a friendlier bunch. It’s hard not to feel welcomed when locals are eager to share stories, recommend a wine (Georgia is famous for its wine), or just chat.</p>
<p data-start="5223" data-end="5598">The thing I love about Tbilisi is how much there is to explore. You can visit ancient churches, hang out in thermal baths, or take a day trip to the nearby mountains. Plus, the city’s public transport system is pretty straightforward, so getting around solo is a breeze. It’s also affordable—definitely one of those places where your budget stretches farther than you expect.</p>
<p data-start="5600" data-end="5853">However, Tbilisi is still a bit of a hidden gem, so don’t expect a ton of other solo travelers. But that’s exactly why I loved it: you get to experience something raw and real, without the tourist-centric vibe that often accompanies more popular cities.</p>

<h4 data-start="5993" data-end="6020">5. <strong data-start="6001" data-end="6020">Porto, Portugal</strong></h4>
<p data-start="6022" data-end="6340">Now, this one’s a bit more well-known, but hear me out: Porto is still one of the most underrated European cities. It’s smaller than Lisbon, which makes it feel more intimate and, honestly, more manageable for solo travelers. The food scene here is top-notch (again, the pastries!), and the riverfront views? Gorgeous.</p>
<p data-start="6342" data-end="6814">One of my favorite things to do was walk around the narrow streets of the Ribeira district, just taking in the atmosphere. There's a real sense of history in the city, but it also feels like it’s constantly evolving. I think that's what makes Porto so special: it’s old, it’s new, it’s vibrant, and it’s laid-back. Whether you’re touring wine cellars, eating grilled sardines, or just sitting at a café watching the sunset, Porto has a way of making you feel... connected.</p>

<hr data-start="6941" data-end="6944">
<p data-start="6946" data-end="7355" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The beauty of solo travel is that you get to choose your own adventure. Whether you’re seeking tranquility, culture, or something in between, these underrated destinations offer a refreshing break from the usual crowd. And, who knows, maybe you’ll find yourself returning to one of these places for a second visit—or more. After all, there’s always something new to discover when you travel on your own terms.</p>`,
