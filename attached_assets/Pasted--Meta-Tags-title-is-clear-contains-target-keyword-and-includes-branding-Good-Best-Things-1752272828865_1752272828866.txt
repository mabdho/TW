🟡 SEO Areas for Improvement
🔸 Image Optimization
⚠️ Images like porto-hero.jpg are referenced, but not marked with <img> + alt attributes.

🔧 Use:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="/images/cities/porto-hero.jpg" alt="Scenic view of Porto city" />
Important for image SEO and accessibility.

🔸 Schema Enhancements
Current TravelGuide schema is good, but consider:

Adding mainEntityOfPage

Adding a list of attractions using ItemList or TouristAttraction schema.

Adding FAQPage structured data for common questions about Porto.

🔸 Content Depth
From the snippet, it looks more like a homepage with teaser content.

For the actual /best-things-to-do-in-porto page:

Ensure at least 1,500–2,500 words of rich, original content.

Use:

Lists (<ul><li>)

Detailed attraction descriptions

Travel tips

Internal/external links

❌ Missing or Potentially Weak Elements
Missing Element	Why It Matters
Breadcrumbs (Schema + UI)	Helps navigation and improves SERP appearance.
Lazy Loading for Non-critical Images	Boosts load speed. Use loading="lazy" on <img>.
404, 301 Handling	Not visible in this file, but make sure server-side SEO is handled.
Custom Open Graph Images per Page	Currently uses one image; dynamic OG images per city page are better.
Alt Attributes for Decorative Sections	bg-gray-200 sections should eventually have real images with alt text.

✅ Summary Verdict:
Your HTML is well-optimized for SEO, particularly for:

Title and meta setup

Semantic structure

Social media integration

Performance optimizations

But for perfect SEO:

✅ Add alt tags + real images, ✅ improve schema, and ✅ ensure deep content for each city page.
