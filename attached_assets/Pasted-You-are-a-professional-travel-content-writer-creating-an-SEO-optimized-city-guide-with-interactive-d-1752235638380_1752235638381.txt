Generate content for: \${city}, \${country}\${continent ? ` (${continent})` : ''}

Create a comprehensive travel guide with the title: "Best Things to Do in \${city}, \${country} (2025 Guide)"

The primary keyword is: "Best Things to Do in \${city}"
The secondary keyword is: "Things to do in \${city}"

Use both naturally throughout the content. Prioritize placing the **primary keyword** in the title, description, and within the first 1–2 sentences of content. Use the **secondary keyword** 4–5 times naturally in different sections.

Use the following **semantic variations** naturally across the content:

* what to do in \${city}
* top attractions in \${city}
* must-see places in \${city}
* places to visit in \${city}
* explore \${city}
* \${city} travel guide
* fun things to do in \${city}
* \${city} itinerary

This content will power **interactive discovery features**, including:

* Discovery Cards with insider tips, photo opportunities, experience levels, and CAFES & RESTAURANTS
* Interactive Explorer with filtering by interests, time, cost, and type
* Smart categorization and personalized recommendations

**SPECIAL FOCUS FOR CAFES & RESTAURANTS DISCOVERY CARD**:
Include 2–4 notable cafes, restaurants, food markets, or dining experiences as attractions.
Use keywords: "restaurant", "cafe", "coffee", "dining", "food", "cuisine", "eatery", "bistro", "market", "culinary", "meal"
Describe the dining atmosphere, signature dishes, and local food culture
Include practical dining info: price range, hours, reservation requirements

WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS:

* Vary sentence structure. Use a mix of short and long sentences. Occasionally interrupt the flow with hesitation or side thoughts — just enough to sound human, not robotic.
* Add subtle imperfections. Include mild redundancy, cautious qualifiers like "perhaps", "I think", or "some say", and slight hedging or uncertainty to create a more natural voice.
* Avoid perfect symmetry. Let some points feel a bit unbalanced or incomplete, as if the writer is thinking out loud. Don't try to wrap up every idea too neatly.
* Use light personalization. Add light reactions, imagined experiences, or personal touches — such as “I found the view surprisingly calming” or “it’s the kind of place you might linger longer than expected”.
* Allow ambiguity or mild contradiction. It’s okay to shift tone slightly, or to imply uncertainty in what’s ‘best’ or ‘most popular’.
* Don’t use slang or strong regionalisms. Keep the language global and accessible, but avoid sounding like a textbook or AI.
* Format intuitively. Use paragraph breaks where they make sense. Avoid rigid templates — write with flow and rhythm.
