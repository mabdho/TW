          <h3>🤫 Local Secrets</h3>
          <ul class="discovery-list">
            <li>To see the Duomo without the massive crowds, go on Tuesdays at 8:30 AM. Enter through the south side entrance on Via Arcivescovado, which is usually less congested than the main entrance.</li><li>Instead of the tourist trap MilanoCard, purchase a 'Biglietto giornaliero' day pass for €7.60, valid for 24 hours on all ATM transport. Download the 'ATM Milano Official App' for real-time bus/tram tracking. As a courtesy, allow elderly passengers priority seating on buses and trams.</li><li>A realistic budget for 3 days in Milan is €45-60 per day, excluding accommodation. This includes: Lunch (€15), Dinner (€20), Transportation (€7.60 day pass), and one attraction (€10-15).</li><li>Skip the overpriced shops in the fashion district. Instead, head to the Isola district, specifically Via Paolo Sarpi, for authentic Chinese goods, spices, and textiles at bargain prices. Bargaining is accepted in most smaller shops – start by offering 70% of the asking price.</li><li>Avoid eating near the Duomo or Galleria. These areas are packed with tourist traps like 'Spizzico' pizza. A better alternative is 'Luini' (Via Santa Radegonda, 16) for delicious and cheap Panzerotti, a local favorite.</li><li>During Milan Fashion Week (February/September), the city is incredibly crowded and expensive. However, if you're an art lover, 'Artigiano in Fiera' (December) at Fieramilano Rho is a massive event to explore and buy handcrafted goods. Check dates online as they change annually.</li>

        <h3 class="attraction-name">Duomo di Milano</h3>
        <div class="attraction-description">Overview<br>The Duomo di Milano is the city's iconic cathedral, a breathtaking example of Gothic architecture.

Inside, you'll find stunning stained glass windows, elaborate sculptures, and a sense of grandeur that's hard to match. It's certainly one of the must-see places in Milan.<br><br>Best Photo Spots<br>For stunning photos, head to the rooftop at sunset for panoramic views of the city. The spires and statues silhouetted against the colorful sky make for a magical photo opportunity. Another great spot is the Piazza del Duomo itself, especially early in the morning before the crowds arrive.<br><br>Insider Tips<br>Tip: Book your tickets online in advance to avoid long queues. Consider a guided tour to learn more about the cathedral's history and art. It's worth the climb (or elevator ride) to the rooftop for unparalleled views. Be sure to dress respectfully; shoulders and knees must be covered.</div>

        <div class="attraction-description">Overview<br>Santa Maria delle Grazie is a church and Dominican convent, a UNESCO World Heritage site, but the main draw is Leonardo da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' ('Il Cenacolo').

Photography is not allowed inside the refectory.<br><br>Insider Tips<br>Tip: Book tickets online well in advance (at least 2-3 months) at vivaticket.it.

        <div class="attraction-description">Overview<br>The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is a stunning 19th-century shopping arcade located next to the Duomo. It's one of the world's oldest active shopping malls and a major landmark of Milan. The architecture is incredible, with a glass-domed roof and ornate decorations. Even if you're not planning on shopping, it's worth a visit just to admire the beauty of this place.

The intricate mosaics and the light filtering through the glass create a magical effect. Also, be sure to capture the mosaics on the floor, including the famous bull.
